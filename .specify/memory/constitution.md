## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-02
- Q: Team structure and decision authority model? → A: Centralized Technical Authority (Chief Architect makes major decisions; team implements)
- Q: Escalation process for requirement deviations (coverage waiver, MISRA violation, complexity overage)? → A: Severity-based escalation: ASIL D (Critical Path) requires Chief Architect + PM approval + mandatory RCA; ASIL A-C (Standard) requires Design Lead + RCA; all deviations documented
- Q: Complexity metric for enforcement? → A: Cyclomatic Complexity (CC): RTL modules ≤10, Firmware functions ≤15; values exceeding threshold require documentation + design review approval
- Q: Formal interface specification method for system integration testing? → A: Formalized interface contracts with signal specs, protocols, error handling, performance bounds; UVM (HW) + pytest (FW) verification; all normal + boundary cases covered
- Q: Automotive reliability standards? → A: ISO 26262-1:2018 (Functional Safety) + AEC-Q100 (automotive-grade electronic component testing)

## Core Principles

### I. Requirements-Driven Development
ASPICE-compliant requirements traceability MUST be maintained throughout development lifecycle. All work traces bidirectionally from stakeholder requirements → system requirements → hardware/software design → implementation → verification. Every code commit, design decision, and test case MUST reference a traced requirement. Documentation MUST maintain explicit traceability links.

**Rationale**: Enables verification that delivered system meets all stakeholder needs; supports ASPICE SYS.1-5, SWE.1-6, HWE.1-5 certification requirements.

### II. Verification at All Levels (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Unit, integration, system, and qualification testing MUST be performed per ASPICE process areas. Firmware: 100% statement coverage + 100% branch coverage mandatory per SWE.4. Hardware: UVM testbench with 100% code + 100% functional coverage per HWE.4. System integration tests MUST verify interface contracts. Qualification tests MUST verify customer acceptance criteria.

**Rationale**: Ensures PCIe Gen5 SSD reliability and ASPICE Level 3 compliance; prevents field failures due to untested code paths.

### III. Code Quality Non-Negotiables
Firmware MUST follow MISRA C:2012 coding standard with zero critical static analysis violations. Hardware RTL MUST follow SystemVerilog coding guidelines with zero critical lint warnings. All code MUST undergo peer review before integration. Design reviews at module and chip level REQUIRED. Low complexity enforcement mandated via Cyclomatic Complexity limits: RTL modules ≤CC 10, firmware functions ≤CC 15. Deviations require documented justification and design review approval.

**Rationale**: SSD controllers handle critical storage I/O; coding defects cause data loss; ASPICE HWE.3, SWE.3 require disciplined implementation practices.

### IV. Process Compliance & Configuration Management
Version control (Git) with defined branching strategy MANDATORY. All configuration items (code, documents, tools) under CM control. Baselines established at milestones. Configuration audits per ASPICE SUP.8. Problem resolution and change request management formalized per SUP.9 and SUP.10.

**Rationale**: Hardware + firmware integration complexity demands version control discipline; ASPICE SUP.8-10 formalizes change control to prevent regressions.

### V. Documentation Standards & Artifact Control
Standardized templates required for all ASPICE work products (requirements specs, design docs, test plans, verification reports). All documents version-controlled. Formal review and approval required. Traceability maintained across artifacts. Documentation must be accessible and maintained for product lifecycle.

**Rationale**: PCIe Gen5 complexity and automotive quality demands comprehensive documentation; ASPICE SUP.7 requires standardized documentation management.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

### Phase Gates
1. **Requirements Baseline** (SYS.1-2): All stakeholder and system requirements documented, traced, baselined
2. **Architecture Review** (SYS.3, SWE.2, HWE.2): Hardware/software architecture reviewed, interfaces defined, traced to requirements
3. **Design Review** (SWE.3, HWE.3): Detailed RTL and firmware designs reviewed, static analysis clean, tests pass before implementation
4. **Integration Complete** (SYS.4, SWE.5, HWE.5): All units integrated, interface tests passing, traceability verified
5. **Customer Acceptance** (SYS.5, SWE.6): Qualification tests pass, customer approves, product baselined

### Code Review Requirements
- MANDATORY peer review on all code (RTL and firmware)
- MISRA C:2012 compliance verified in firmware reviews
- SystemVerilog naming and Cyclomatic Complexity guidelines enforced (RTL ≤CC 10, Firmware ≤CC 15)
- Coverage gaps must be explained (not waived)
- Complexity deviations must include justified rationale and design review approval
- Review checklist includes traceability verification

### Testing Gates
- Unit tests MUST exist and PASS before implementation commit
- Coverage reports MUST accompany pull requests
- Integration tests MUST verify formalized interface contracts (signal specifications, protocols, error handling, performance bounds) via UVM (hardware) and pytest/simulation framework (firmware)
- All normal and boundary-case scenarios for each interface MUST be covered
- Regression tests MUST pass on all changes
- Static analysis MUST show zero critical violations

### Configuration Management
- Feature branches follow naming convention: `[issue-id]-[feature-name]`
- Commits reference issue/requirement IDs
- Pull requests link to test results and coverage metrics
- Merges require verification of traceability completeness
- Release baselines tagged immutably

## Governance

**Constitution Authority**: This constitution supersedes all other development practices. When conflicts arise, constitution principles take precedence.

**Amendment Process**: 
- Proposed amendments MUST document: rationale, affected process areas, migration plan, version impact
- Amendments require documented approval from Chief Architect (technical authority per clarification) and project manager
- All changes tracked with version bump and amendment date
- Transitional period defined (minimum 2 weeks) before new rule enforcement
- Requirement deviations (coverage waiver, MISRA violation, complexity overage) escalated per severity-based process: ASIL D requires Chief Architect + PM + RCA; ASIL A-C requires Design Lead + RCA

**Version Semantics**:
- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible principle removals/redefinitions (e.g., coverage requirements changed, new ASPICE area added)
- **MINOR**: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

**Compliance Verification**:
- Pull request reviews MUST verify traceability and process compliance
- Complexity justifications required for deviations (documented in commit message)
- Quarterly process audits validate compliance with constitution
- Non-conformances tracked as improvement backlog items

**Runtime Guidance**: See [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) and [AI_INTERACTIONS.md](AI_INTERACTIONS.md) for agent-specific implementation guidance and AI interaction records.
